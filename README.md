GÃ¶del.js
========

An attempt to build a model of computation (arithmetic, for now) from a minimal 
set of primitives and applications of recursion and composition. The set of core operations include:
increment (`incr`), decrement (`decr`, conditional branch (`cond`), and equality (`eq`).

This is a loose implementation of the *S* language of Computability, Complexity, and Languages by Davis et al.
